# What is it?

This is an attempt to use open data from the US government. This project uses a report from the LAPD referencing all the burglaries that occurred in the year of 2015.

The project is currently [hosted here](http://data.socialhive.fr).

## But why did you do it?

This was part of an assignment during my year abroad, but most importantly this is more like a playground where I had the chance to test the D3 library, and play with JavaScript for a bit.

## Goal

The main goal of the visualization is to answer a bunch of questions, such as:

* Which areas of Los Angeles are he most affected by robberies?
* What period of the year is the worst?
* Which particular neighborhood is the most affected in a specific area?

# Deployment

You simply need to host this on a web server. Any server will do.
